		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Loaded potato soup is hearty, creamy, and perfect for cold rainy days. I was first introduced to it by my late uncle, Silas, at a small local
		restaurant I'd never been to before. It quickly became my favorite soup and now I try to go at least once every week. I care about texture a lot, so
		for me what really sets it apart from other soups is the thick almost gravy-like consistency and soft chunks of potatoes. I don't want to understate
		just how important topping it with shredded cheese and crumbled bacon is though, it makes a world of difference for the presentation and adds some
		extra layers of flavor and texture that really send it over the top. In my opinion, loaded potato soup is a little plain, but with the cheddar and
		bacon you're able to make up for what it lacks. I hope you enjoy loaded potato soup as much as I do and share it with someone you think will enjoy it
		too!</p>
		
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>8 potatoes</li>
			<li>1 small white onion</li>
			<li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
			<li>8 cups of milk</li>
			<li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
			<li>raw bacon(I cook my bacon as part of my prep because using the bacon grease makes me feel less wasteful, but if you prefer bacon bits
			you'll need 1/2 cup of butter)</li>
			<li>salt</li>
			<li>pepper</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<h4>Prep</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>cube potatoes</li>
			<li>dice onion</li>
			<li>mince garlic</li>
			<li>shred cheese(you can ignore this step if you're using pre shredded cheddar)</li>
			<li>cook your bacon and be sure to save the grease(if you're using butter and bacon bits/precooked bacon you can ignore this step)</li>
			<li>give your bacon a rough chop once you've cooked it to your desired crispiness</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Cooking</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>set a large pot of water on the stove to boil, heat should be on high</li>
			<li>drop your potatoes in and set a timer for 12-15 minutes once the water starts boiling</li>
			<li>while the potatoes cook, add your bacon grease back to the pan(or melt your butter) and whisk in your flour until smooth</li>
			<li>once it's nice and smooth, slowly stir in the milk and onion</li>
			<li>bring it to a boil then reduce to medium heat and let it simmer</li>
			<li>strain and add your potatoes when the time goes off</li>
			<li>let it all cook another 5 or so minutes</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Finishing Touches</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>get yourself and whoever's with you a nice helping into bowls</li>
			<li>throw some cheese on top</li>
			<li>sprinkle some bacon on top</li>
