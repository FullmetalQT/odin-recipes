		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Loaded potato soup is hearty, creamy, and perfect for cold rainy days. I was first introduced to it by my late uncle, Silas, at a small local
		restaurant I'd never been to before. It quickly became my favorite soup and now I try to go at least once every week. I care about texture a lot, so
		for me what really sets it apart from other soups is the thick almost gravy-like consistency and soft chunks of potatoes. I don't want to understate
		just how important topping it with shredded cheese and crumbled bacon is though, it makes a world of difference for the presentation and adds some
		extra layers of flavor and texture that really send it over the top. In my opinion, loaded potato soup is a little plain, but with the cheddar and
		bacon you're able to make up for what it lacks. I hope you enjoy loaded potato soup as much as I do and share it with someone you think will enjoy it
		too!</p>

			<li>1 small white onion</li>
			<li>8 cups of milk</li>
			<li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
			<li>raw bacon(I cook my bacon as part of my prep because using the bacon grease makes me feel less wasteful, but if you prefer bacon bits
