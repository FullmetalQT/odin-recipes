This will be my first Odin Project project and my first project at all in a very long time! It'll be an application of my recently acquired HTML knowledge. I'm very
excited to see how this turns out and I'm really glad to be getting back into coding after being discouraged for so long.

Finished! Well, there's more that I should do, but I'm calling it good because I'm getting bored using what I currently know. I'll likely revisit this at some point
though so that I can play around with newer knowledge and make it look pretty.
